Instructor: Jungsoo (Sue) Lim

Course Information:

a) Advanced programming techniques; elementary data structures such as dynamic
arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, sorting and searching algorithms.
Laboratory activities on problem analysis and software development.

b) Prerequisites: CS2012

c) Recommended Prerequisite: Math 207, Math 248

d) This course is required in the BS program

Course Goals The Student Learning Outcomes that are addressed by the course are:

SLO #2: Students will be able to demonstrate fluency in at least one
programming language and acquaintance with at least three more.

SLO #3: Students will have a strong foundation in the design, analysis, and
application of many types of algorithms.

SLO #5. Students will have the training to analyze problems and identify and
define the computing requirements appropriate to their solutions.

SLO #6. Students will have the training to design, implement, and evaluate large
software systems working both individually and collaboratively.

SLO #7. Students will be able to communicate effectively orally and in writing.


Other outcomes of instruction: At the end of the course students are able to:

• Use recursion as a tool to solve some specific problems.

• Know the standard Abstract Data Types, and their implementations.

• Study and use different available JAVA Data Structures.

• Know the standard searching and sorting algorithms and their
efficiency.

• Understand the complexity analysis for some simple software.

Brief list of topics to be covered:

• Recursion

• Algorithm Efficiency (brief)

• Sorting

• Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Priority Queues

• Binary Search Trees

• Hash table

• Graphs and Applications (Optional)
