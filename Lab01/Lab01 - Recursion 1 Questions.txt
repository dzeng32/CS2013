1) (5) Write a recursive method that computes x^n for a positive integer n using the following header:


public static double powerN(double x, int n){

//implement body

}

2) (5) Write a recursive method that computes the following series using the following header:

S = 1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4+ ...+n/ (n + 1)

public static double sum(int n){
//implement body

}

3) Extra Credit (5) - Compute greatest common divisor using recursion.

gcd(m, n) is defined recursively as

1. if m%n is 0, return n

2. otherwise, gcd(m,n) is gcd(n, m%n)

public static int gcd(int m, int n){

}
